# Invite users to your organization

By default, all the users added to your Organization will have access to all the apps within. To invite new users, click the **Users & Permissions** link under your organization menu.

### Roles

For every invited user, there are 2 roles available out-of-the-box:

* **Admin** – can invite other users and change the Organization settings.
* **Editor** – can view and develop apps.

Apart from default user roles, you can [create and assign custom roles](https://docs.uibakery.io/starter-guide/custom-roles) to your users.
