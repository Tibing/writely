# Deploy and share applications

To deploy your app, click the **Deployment** button. Give your release a name and assign a version. If necessary, you can leave a description of the changes, etc. You can deploy to both staging and production environments, or start with staging for testing purposes and deploy to production after  successful testing. Click **Deploy** to publish your application.

&#x20;Youâ€™ll get shareable links that you can either make public and send to your team members and colleagues or keep private.
