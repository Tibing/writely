# Custom roles

{% hint style="danger" %}
Custom roles are available on Team and Enterprise plans
{% endhint %}

You can create custom roles for managing access permissions to your different apps. To create a custom role:

1. Open **Settings** - **Users & Permissions**
2. On the **Roles** tab, click **Add Role**
3. Give your new role a meaningful name and set permissions level to the apps that the users with that role should have access to.
4. To save the role, click **Create Role**

If required, you can modify the role or remove it, when it's no longer necessary. Once the role is created, you can assign it to your invited users.
