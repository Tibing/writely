# Create an app

When you sign up for UI Bakery, you become an admin of your organization. Now, you can invite team members and other users to it, create apps together, share access and manage roles and permissions. All the apps created within your organization are available to all your users considering their permission level.

To start building a new app, click **Create an app.** You can choose an icon and color for your application. Select the appropriate template, or start from scratch by clicking on a blank one.&#x20;
