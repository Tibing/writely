# Generators for CRUD operations

We realize it might be challenging to start building an application from scratch. Apart from that, a lot of time can be spent on building standard apps. To save your time, use a generator.

#### What is Generator?

Generator is used to quickly generate basic components and actions based on your data source.&#x20;

#### How does Generator work?

Once you connect your data source, you can open the Generator tab and find the suggestions created upon the structure of your tables. A generator is available for a Table, a Form, a Metric, and a Chart. Apart from the components, the actions are also pre-defined. You can select any suggestion that works best for you, e.g. add a standard table or a table with the ability to add, update and delete the data.

#### Building an application with a generator

Let's go through the process of creating a simple application with a generator.&#x20;

![Example application built on a generator](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2022-01-17 at 13.39.28.png>)

1. [Connect your data source](https://docs.uibakery.io/starter-guide/read-and-write-data/connect-a-data-source) first
2. Proceed to the builder and open the **Components** pane.&#x20;
3. Click on the generator icon to open the list of available suggestions for your application.

4\. By default, you will see a set of standard components in the list. If you need a table with additional options, such as add, update and delete the data right in the table, type _CRUD_ in the search bar. Put a necessary table onto the canvas and adjust its appearance if required.

5\. As a next step, we will add a _**Form**_ near the table. You can type _orders_ _form_ into the search bar to find the required form. Place the form near the table onto the canvas. Notice that the ADD action has been created automatically as well.

6\. You can follow the same process to add a Metric and a Chart.

7\. The application is now ready to be used. Click the **Deployment** button, assign a name and a version to the current release and click **Deploy** to publish your app. The shareable links will be provided at the button of the **Deployment** window.
