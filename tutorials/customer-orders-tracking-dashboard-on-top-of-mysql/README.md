# Customer Orders Tracking Dashboard on top of MySQL

In this tutorial, you will build a complex dashboard for tracking customers, their orders, shipment status, and payment information, on top of MySQL data.

**Level**: Beginner/ Medium ðŸ¤“

**What weâ€™ll cover:**

* Connecting My SQL database as a data source&#x20;
* Loading data from multiple MySQL tables
* Displaying and managing your data
* Adding entry forms and visualization metrics for data analysis

**What we'll do:**

* Connect your MySQL database to UI Bakery;
* Load data from MySQL and display it in Tables and other components (Form, Details, etc.);
* Add visualization metrics for data analysis;
* Link Table to Details components;
* Add a page with aggregated data about a certain Customer.

We assume that you already have a MySQL database and an active UI Bakery account. Also, weâ€™d recommend you to get familiar with [UI Bakery basics](https://docs.uibakery.io/starter-guide/getting-started) prior to starting.

Please note that we will build a multi-page application, so itâ€™s vital that you follow the steps successively.

### **Introduction** <a href="#introduction" id="introduction"></a>

The preliminary step in building your application is [creating an app](https://docs.uibakery.io/starter-guide/create-a-project). Once logged in to UI Bakery, you will be redirected to your dashboard where all your apps are stored. To start a new app:

* Click **Create a new app**
* Give it a meaningful name
* On the templates page, select the blank template
* You can now proceed to the **Builder**
