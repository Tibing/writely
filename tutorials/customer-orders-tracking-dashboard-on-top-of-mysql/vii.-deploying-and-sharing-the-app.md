# VII. Deploying and sharing the app

You have built a complex dashboard, that allows tracking your Customers' orders and payment information, order statuses, and customer's credit limit. You can now [deploy and share the application](https://docs.uibakery.io/starter-guide/manage-users-and-permissions/share-and-invite-users) with your teammates and start using it.&#x20;

Click the **Deployment** button, specify the name and a version for your release, and click **Deploy**. You will get the application’s link that can be shared across your team. In case the application is for private use, don’t forget to switch the toggle to **Private** in the app's settings**.**
