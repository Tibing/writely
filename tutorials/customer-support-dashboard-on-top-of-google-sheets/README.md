**Level**: Beginner ðŸ¤“

**What weâ€™ll cover:**

* Connecting Google Sheets to UI Bakery;
* Adding charts and KPI metrics;
* Deploying the application;
* Sharing the application with your teammates.

**What we'll do:**

* Connect your Google Sheets docs to UI Bakery;
* Load Customers data from Google Sheets and display it inside a table and other components;
* Add visualization metrics and charts to calculate the support team's KPIs;
* Link tables to other components;
* Add an option of creating new customers directly in the app and sending the data back to the data source.

We assume that you already have a Google Sheets document with your data and an active UI Bakery account. Also, weâ€™d recommend you to get familiar with [UI Bakery basics](https://docs.uibakery.io/starter-guide/getting-started) prior to starting.&#x20;

Please note that we will build a multi-page application, so itâ€™s vital that you follow the steps successively.

### **Introduction** <a href="#introduction" id="introduction"></a>

The preliminary step in building your application is [creating an app](https://docs.uibakery.io/starter-guide/create-a-project). Once logged in to UI Bakery, you are redirected to your dashboard, where all your apps are stored. To start a new app:

* Click **Create a new app.**
* Give it a meaningful name.
* On the templates page, select the blank template.
* You can now proceed to the **Builder**
