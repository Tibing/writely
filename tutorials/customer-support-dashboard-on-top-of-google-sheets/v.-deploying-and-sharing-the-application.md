# V. Deploying and sharing the application

Now that you've built a support dashboard with your customers' data and all the important metrics, you can [deploy it and share it](https://docs.uibakery.io/starter-guide/organization-settings-and-user-permissions/share-and-invite-users) with your teammates.

To publish your app, click the **Deployment** button in the upper right corner of the builder. Specify the details of your release and assign it a version. You can deploy to staging first to test the application, and then go ahead and release it to production.

As you deploy your application, you will get the links to the application that can be shared with your team.
