# VI. Deploying and sharing the application

We have built an interactive dashboard, that allows tracking the projects, measuring project leads’ workload, controlling the amount of the currently active projects, and overall managing the project’s data. You can now [deploy and share the application](https://docs.uibakery.io/starter-guide/manage-users-and-permissions/share-and-invite-users) with your teammates and start using it.&#x20;

Click the **Deployment** button, specify the name and a version of your release, and click **Deploy**. You will get the application’s link that can be shared across your team. In case the application is for private use, don’t forget to switch the toggle to **Private** in the application's settings**.**

That’s it! You’ve built a basic dashboard for project tracking on top of Airtable data and are now ready to dig deeper into UI Bakery.&#x20;
