**What weâ€™ll cover:**

* Connecting to Airtable data source
* Adding Components to view and represent the data
* Sharing the application and managing access permissions to the application

We assume that you already have active Airtable and UI Bakery accounts. If you are not familiar with UI Bakery basics, weâ€™d recommend you to quickly get acquainted with the [essentials](https://docs.uibakery.io/starter-guide/getting-started).

### **Introduction**&#x20;

The preliminary step in building your application is [creating an app](https://docs.uibakery.io/starter-guide/create-a-project). Once logged in to UI Bakery, you will be redirected to your dashboard, where all your apps are stored. To start a new app:

* Click **Create a new app**
* Give it a meaningful name
* On the templates page, select the blank template
* You can now proceed to the Builder
