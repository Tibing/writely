# Link components

### **Linking a Table to a Details component**

**Use Case 1**: letâ€™s say you have a Table, and would like to have a separate form to view the details of a tableâ€™s record. That means you need to connect the Table with the **Details** component. Letâ€™s see how this could be achieved. For our example, we will use a Products table and will add an additional Details component to display product details below.

1. Start with [adding a Table and loading data into it](https://docs.uibakery.io/basics/starter-guide/load-and-display-data).
2. Once the data is there, you can add a **Details** component. By default, it is connected to the previous Action, thatâ€™s why youâ€™ll see the same fields there as in the Table

However, the Details do not contain any data at the moment. Letâ€™s connect the component with the Table so that we could see the product info on the Details form upon a click on a certain Tableâ€™s record

* Click on the **Details** and remove a default Action populated in the Data property field.
* Instead, we need to specify the value of the selected Table row. This can be done by using the variable `selectedRow.data`

* Populate an object instead of the action into the **Data property** field following the pattern `tableName.selectedRow.data` - in our case, that would be `{{ ui.productsTable.selectedRow.data }}`. Note that you can start typing `selected` - the autocomplete will suggest to you all the available options&#x20;

Check the result - details change as you select different records in the Table. Good job! ðŸ˜Ž

### **Linking a Table to a Form component**

**Use Case 2**: you have a Products table and would like to have a separate Form, where you could both see and update the details. For this case, you could use the **Form** component instead of Details. Letâ€™s see how to link a Table with a Form and edit the data directly from the Form.

1. Add a _**Table**_ and [load data into it](https://docs.uibakery.io/basics/starter-guide/load-and-display-data).&#x20;
2. Then, add a Form component. The Form is connected to the selected Action by default, and will already contain it in the Data properties

Letâ€™s make the Form display a value of the selected Table row so that we could modify its value and send it back. Change the Data value to `tableName.selectedRow.data`

The Form now has the same structure as the Table. If you click on the Table row, the row value will appear in the Form

Now, you can proceed to [configuring the Form to update details and send them back to the database](https://docs.uibakery.io/basics/starter-guide/send-data-and-update-records)
